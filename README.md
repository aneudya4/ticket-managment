### Technical Approach
Review the the design prototype End-to-End then structure a plan on steps and implementation.

Break down views into tasks using Trello
Setup the project structure
Implemented static views and control
Update static view to mock data 

I would recommend changing  the way waitling works, I beleive is misleading allowing the user to select more tickets than the ones that are available.

I would also add a add to cart button  when user selects a ticket or a book.
