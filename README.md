### Technical Approach
Review the the design prototype End-to-End then structure a plan on steps and implementation.

<p>Break down views into tasks using Trello</p>
<p>Setup the project structure</p>
<p>Implemented static views and control</p>
<p>Update static view to mock data </p>

<p>
I would recommend changing the way waitlisting works, I believe is misleading allowing the user to select more tickets than the ones that are available.</p>
<p>I would add a section for tickets with a small quantity available, there the users would be able to add themselves to a waitlist for the ticket of their choice.</p>


<p>
I would also add a add to cart button  when user selects a ticket or a book.</p>
