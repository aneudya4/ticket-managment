### Technical Approach
Review the the design prototype End-to-End then structure a plan on steps and implementation.
<p>Break down views into tasks using Trello</p>
<p>Setup the project structure</p>
<p>Implemented static views and control</p>
<p>Update static view to mock data </p>

<p>
I would recommend changing  the way waitling works, I beleive is misleading allowing the user to select more tickets than the ones that are available.</p>


<p>
I would also add a add to cart button  when user selects a ticket or a book.</p>
